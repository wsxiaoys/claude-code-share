### Usage

There are several ways to use `claude-code-share`:

#### Interactive Mode

This is the easiest way to get started. Simply run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npx claude-code-share
```

This will open an interactive menu where you can select the conversation you want to share.

> **Note**: You can also use the short alias `npx ccs`.

#### Sharing from a File

If you have a conversation saved to a file, you can share it directly:

```bash
npx claude-code-share /path/to/your/conversation.jsonl
```

#### Using Stdin

You can also pipe the contents of a conversation file into the tool:

```bash
cat /path/to/your/conversation.jsonl | npx claude-code-share
```

This is particularly useful for scripting and automation.

#### Status Line Integration

You can display a share link directly in your Claude Code status line for quick access. To set this up, run the following command within Claude Code:

```
/statusline setup "npx claude-code-share statusline"
```

After running the command, restart Claude Code, and you will see a share link in the status line, whenever you run `! npx claude-code-share` in the chat, the status line will be updated with the new share link.

### Adding a New Provider
